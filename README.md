This is a beginner level Python project done by me during the 1st semester.

This project aims at creating a web-like interface to enable users access information about different countries as well as addresses of different places on earth. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes the implementation and usage of the project simple and elegant.
Part 1 of the project takes in the country name from the user from a list of country names. It displays a relevant image from the country as well as the capital, currency and languages spoken in that country. Then the user will be allowed to access the Wikipedia page, climate page and google maps web pages of the region through three buttons. The availability of all the key points on the country makes this part of the project a very useful research tool to users.
Part 2 of the project takes in the name of any place on the planet and displays the address of the place as it is set in the ‘geopy’ module. In case the information regarding the same is not available, then it does not display anything.
Python 3.10.2 has been used to implement this project. Visual Studio Code IDE has been used to write the code.
All additional packages used in the project have been imported through pip by executing ‘pip install <package_name >’ in the command terminal.
